# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project's goal is to create a playable version of browser tic-tac-toe. There are 3 difficulties: Easy, Medium and Hard. The AI will make its moves acoording to the algorythm of the difficulty you select.

The project is now finished. I will keep improving the hard difficulty AI so that it's even more difficult to win. I will also keep searching for bugs and fix them. 

If you find a bug, I'd appreciate it if you sent me a description of the bug and screenshots to this email:
