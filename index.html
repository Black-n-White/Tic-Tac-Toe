                    version of browser
                    tic-tac-toe.
                    There are 3 difficulties: Easy, Medium and
                    Hard. The AI will make its moves acoording to the algorythm of the difficulty you select.

                    The project is now finished. I will keep improving the hard difficulty AI so that it's even more
                    difficult to win. I
                    will also keep searching for bugs and fix them.
                    <a href="https://github.com/Black-n-White/Tic-Tac-Toe">Here</a> is the link to the GitHub repo with
                    my code.
                    If you find a bug, I'd appreciate it if you sent me a description of the bug and screenshots to this
                    email:
                    vadim.shvydun@gmail.com

                    The first thing you can see on the page is a selector of difficulties. You can choose between three
                    - Easy, Medium, and Hard. I'd recommend starting with Easy and climbing your way up to Hard.
                    Disclaimer: it's about 10x harder to win on Medium difficulty than on Easy, and almost impossible to
                    win on Hard. Not fully impossible though, you just need a bit of testing and some luck. The game is
                    played exactly as traditional tic-tac-toe is. To make a move, just click on a cell. You have the
                    first move. Choose a free cell and wait for the AI to do its move. Get three of your symbols in a
                    row or diagonal to win. The game will end automatically once you or the AI win, or there are no
                    free cells left. I challenge <i><b>you</b></i> to win against Hard difficulty!
